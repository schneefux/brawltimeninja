She never understood why Colt got to steal the limelight...}}\n{{Portrait}}\nShelly is the {{Rarity|Starting}} [[:Category:Brawlers|Brawler]] that is unlocked upon beginning the game. She has moderate health and damage output, and a fast movement speed. Her attack is a burst of shotgun shells that deal high damage up close. Her Super knocks surviving enemies back and destroys obstacles, similarly dealing high damage up close. Her first Gadget, Fast Forward, allows her to dash a few tiles to the direction she is facing. Her second Gadget, Clay Pigeons, narrows the width and increases the range of her attacks for the next 5 seconds. Her first Star Power, Shell Shock, makes her Super momentarily slow enemies down. Her second Star Power, Band-Aid, gives her a bar that charges over time and, when fully charged, heals her when her health falls below 40%. Her Hypercharge, Double Barrel, increases the spread and number of projectiles her Super fires.\n\n==Attack: Buckshot==\n{{Quote|Shelly's boomstick fires a wide spread of pellets to a medium range. The more pellets hit, the greater the damage.}}\nShelly fires a burst of shotgun pellets that deal low damage by themselves, but can deal a lot together. The attack deals more damage at close range since more pellets will hit the enemy, but the range of her attack is quite long, making her able to charge her Super from afar without risking elimination. This attack allows Shelly to excel in close-quarters combat, especially against Brawlers with low health and/or shorter-ranged attacks.\n\n==Super: Super Shell==\n{{Quote|Shelly's Super Shell obliterates both cover and enemies. Any survivors get knocked back.}}\nShelly's Super fires a high-damaging burst of pellets which destroys obstacles and knocks enemies back. Like her main attack, the pellets spread out and deal massive damage at close range. Note that the individual pellets cannot pierce through walls, and will disappear upon destroying a wall tile.\n\n==Gadgets==\n===Fast Forward===\n{{Quote|Shelly dashes ahead, skipping a few unnecessary steps!}}\n{{Gadget|1}}\nShelly dashes 3.33 tiles in the direction she is facing upon using this Gadget. However, it is cancelled if she is stunned, pulled, or knocked back, and she cannot dash through walls or water and the dash will be interrupted if she dashes into any of them.\n\n===Clay Pigeons===\n{{Quote|On activation, for the next 5 seconds Shelly's main attacks focuses the fire to a smaller area with an increased range.}}\n{{Gadget|2}}\nFor the next 5 seconds, Shelly's main attacks will have their spread decreased by 67% and their range increased to 10 tiles, as well as a projectile speed boost. A Gadget symbol will glow above Shelly's head signaling this Gadget's activation and usage, as well as a glowing attack joystick. This Gadget's cooldown starts after the 5 seconds are up.\n\n==Star Powers==\n===Shell Shock===\n{{Quote|Shelly's Super shells slow down enemies for 2 seconds!}}\n{{StarPower|1}}\nEnemies hit by Shelly's Super are slowed down by a considerable amount for 2 seconds.  \n\n===Band-Aid===\n{{Quote|When Shelly falls below 40% health, she instantly heals for 2220 health. Band-Aid recharges in 15 seconds.}}\n{{StarPower|2}}\nShelly gains a bar similar to [[Bibi]]'s Home Run bar, which takes 15 seconds to charge up completely. If she falls below 40% health and the bar is fully charged, she instantly heals 2220 health, and the bar resets. However, if Shelly has over 40% health, her bar is full, and she gets defeated in one blow by a high-damage Brawler like [[Bull]], her Star Power will not activate, and she will have to wait another 15 seconds to get Band-Aid back after respawning, regardless of if it was charged or not. The amount of health healed from Band-Aid scales with any type of power-ups, including [[Showdown]] Power Cubes and will always heal 30% of her total health, excluding any type of shield. \n\n==Hypercharge: Double Barrel==\n{{Quote|Super Shell is 33% larger.}}{{Hypercharge}}When activated, Shelly's Super spread is increased by 33%, and the number of projectiles is increased from 9 to 12. She also gains a 25% speed and shield boost, as well as a 5% damage boost.\n\n==Mutation==\n{{RemovedContent|section}}\n{{Quote|Shelly's shotgun fires twice.}}<div style=\"float: right;\">[[File:Mutation.png|64px|link=]]</div>Shelly fired her shotgun like normal, and another round of shotgun shells followed in quick succession, effectively doubling her damage. This did not affect her Super or Hypercharged Super, however, it does affect her Clay Pigeons Gadget. This also effectively doubles her Super charge rate, allowing her to chain Supers at point blank range.\n\n==Tips==\n===Game Modes and Maps===\n*Shelly is moderately good in [[Brawl Ball]] since she can destroy the walls blocking the enemy's goal and allow your team to score more easily. A rather useful tactic some people use is shooting the ball and then immediately using her Super to break any obstacles in the way and pushing back enemies in front of the goal, This could possibly pave the way for a victory in that game mode.\n*In Duo Showdown, if you have a teammate with ranged jumps like [[El Primo]] or [[Edgar]], you can charge your Super up and then get defeated on purpose. When you are just about to respawn, your teammate can jump near an enemy team so that you respawn next to them. Then, use your Super to eliminate them rapidly. Your immunity shield will protect you while you do this. If your teammate is a squishier Brawler like [[Crow]], they can jump slightly further away from the enemy and you can then use her Fast Forward Gadget to get near the enemies and use the same strategy. This will result in a team-wipe as it works well regardless of the number of Power Cubes the enemy has, since the immunity shield you get after respawning for a couple seconds makes you impossible to defeat for some seconds resulting in giving you enough time to finish the team off. Be wary of Brawlers like Bull or Darryl, though, as they can charge and roll away respectively from you before you respawn.\n*In [[Duo Showdown]], two useful team compositions are Shelly and [[Tara]], or Shelly and [[Gene]], as either of them can pull enemies into Shelly, who can finish them off with her Super.\n*In [[Showdown|Solo Showdown]], if Shelly has her Super, she can wait in a bush, and wait for any enemies to come close by, and then ambush them with her super, and finish them off with her attack.\n\n===Recommended Build===\n*Shelly's Fast Forward Gadget is usually the worse option in certain situations and game modes. Unlike other dashing Gadget's, like [[Maisie]] or [[Max]], Fast Forward gives Shelly no benefits, while Maisie's has a stun and Max has temporary invincibility.\n*Shelly's Clay Pigeons Gadget can be used directly after using her Super at mid-range. While the enemy gets knocked back, Shelly is able to hit all bullets with the longer attacks provided by the Gadget to get maximum value out of it. This is especially effective when combined with her Shell Shock Star Power, allowing Shelly to easily land even more shots and take down foes, usually getting her Super back in the process, which could help her in a later combat.\n*Using her Shell Shock Star Power, Shelly can slow down Brawlers that are trying to escape, allowing her and/or her teammates to catch up and eliminate them. Shelly can also slow down the entire enemy team with her Shell Shock Star Power, making way for a potential team wipe with the help of allies. In [[Showdown]], this can be used to catch up with longer-range Brawlers if they get hit by Shelly's Super.\n*Shelly's Clay Pigeons Gadget channels and increases the range of her shots for a couple seconds, making it easier to charge Supers that could help in later combats. In mirror matches or against medium-range Brawlers, this can be helpful, but her Fast Forward Gadget can give Shelly more advantage. It allows her to get in close range to enemies and ambush them, potentially surprising them if she dashes from a bush. Sometimes, though, you will find yourself using Clay Pigeons in situations where an enemy on low health is out of your normal range and you need to finish them off (like when they have a lot of gems in [[Gem Grab]] or to secure a quick elimination in [[Bounty]] or [[Knockout]], which could potentially give your team a victory).\n\n===Strategies===\n*When using Shelly, take advantage of walls or bushes when approaching long-range Brawlers such as [[Colt]] or [[Rico]] (for Rico, try to avoid having a large assortment of walls by and behind you that he could bounce his projectiles on, which gives him an obvious advantage), since they can attack Shelly out of her range and take down Shelly in the open with ease. To avoid that, be careful when using her Super, as it destroys walls, which gives her an obvious disadvantage against long-ranged Brawlers like those previously mentioned.\n*The spread of Shelly's attacks allows her to sweep bushes and expose any enemies hiding in them without having to go inside the bush, potentially risking being defeated by a high-damage Brawler like [[Bull]].\n*Shelly's Super has the ability to cancel or interrupt other Brawlers' Supers because it knocks them back. For example, she can stop [[Frank]] from using his Super if she hits him with her Super during his wind-up. This can become even more deadly by waiting in a bush and then ambushing, since the enemies won't know you're there and won't be careful when using their Super, giving you an opportunity to surprise them, stopping their Super and potentially defeating them.\n*If Shelly is at low health and is being chased by a Brawler, she can use her Super to knock them back and gain a bit more time to escape. This works even better if she has her Shell Shock Star Power since she can also slow them down for a few seconds. If both of these don't help or she doesn't have her Super, Shelly can also use her Fast Forward Gadget.\n\n===Other=== \n*Shelly is best in maps with lots of bushes and walls as you can hide in a bush and camp. However, be careful when using her Super, as it destroys walls and bushes, which could prove fatal to teammates or Shelly herself if they need to take cover or hide.\n*Similar to Colt's Super, projectiles from Shelly's Super don't pierce through walls, they disappear after breaking one. Keep this in mind if you are trying to use Shelly's Super to defeat a Brawler behind a wall, because the opponent will take less damage due to some of the shells disappearing after breaking a wall; the more walls between you and your enemy (in a scenario where the Super is aimed perfectly at the opponent), the less damage they'll take from the Super.\n*Shelly is an excellent counter to tanks with her Super. However, Shelly is helpless in close-quarters combat without her Super due to the tanks\u2019 superior health and DPS, so try to have your Super charged up before facing them.\n*Defeating assassins with Shelly can be tricky. To defeat such Brawlers, use your Fast Forward Gadget to get closer to the long-range assassins and defeat them at close-quarters. However, this is circumvented if the respective assassin escapes, such as [[Stu]] with his Super. For close-range assassins, focus on landing your shots correctly to quickly defeat them or use her Clay Pigeons Gadget to outrange them.\n\n==Voice Lines==\n{{TranslationToggle|Spanish}}\n{| class=\"article-table\"\n!Spawning\n!In The Lead\n!Receiving Damage\n!Defeating An Enemy\n!Defeated\n!Attacking\n!Activating A Super \n|-\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly start 01.ogg|Filedescription = \"Let's go!\"}} \n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly lead 01.ogg|Filedescription = \"Winning.\"}} \n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly hurt 01.ogg|Filedescription = Shelly whimpers}}\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly kill 01.ogg|Filedescription = {{Translate|\"\u00a1As\u00ed me gusta!\"|\"That's how I like it!\"}}}}\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly die 01.ogg|Filedescription = \"No!\"}}\n|\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly ulti 01.ogg|Filedescription = Shelly laughs}}\n|-\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly start 02.ogg|Filedescription = \"Let's go get 'em.\"}}\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly lead 02.ogg|Filedescription = \"Bling bling.\"}}\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly hurt 02.ogg|Filedescription = Shelly whimpers}}\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly kill 02.ogg|Filedescription = \"Yes!\"}}\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly die 02.ogg|Filedescription = \"No!\"}}\n|\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly ulti 02.ogg|Filedescription = \"Boom!\"}}\n|-\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly start 03.ogg|Filedescription = \"Let's do this.\"}}\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly lead 03.ogg|Filedescription = {{Translate|\"\u00a1Incre\u00edble!\"|\"Incredible!\"}}}}\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly hurt 03.ogg|Filedescription = Shelly whimpers}}\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly kill 03.ogg|Filedescription = \"Yippee!\"}}\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly die 03.ogg|Filedescription = Shelly groans}}\n|\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly ulti 03.ogg|Filedescription = \"Bang.\"}}\n|-\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly start 04.ogg|Filedescription = Shelly laughs}}\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly lead 04.ogg|Filedescription = {{Translate|\"\u00a1Fant\u00e1stico!\"|\"Fantastic!\"}}}}\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly hurt 04.ogg|Filedescription = Shelly groans}}\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly kill 04.ogg|Filedescription = \"Woo-hoo!\"}} \n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly die 04.ogg|Filedescription = Shelly groans}}\n|\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly ulti 04.ogg|Filedescription = Shelly laughs}}\n|-\n|\n|\n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly hurt 05.ogg|Filedescription = Shelly groans}} \n|{{Ogg|Filename = Shelly kill 05.ogg|Filedescription = Shelly laughs}}\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n\n==History==\n*16/08/17:\n**{{Balance|Nerf|Shelly's reload time was increased to 1.5 seconds (from 1.25).}}\n**{{Balance|Nerf|Her main attack range was decreased to 6.67 tiles (from 7.67).}}\n**{{Balance|Neutral|Her main attack shells have a larger spread.}}\n*07/12/17:\n**{{Balance|Neutral|Shelly's Shell Shock Star Power was added.}}\n**{{Balance|Neutral|The health and damage statistics of all Brawlers were multiplied by 4.}}\n*16/01/18: \n**{{Balance|Nerf|Shelly's Shell Shock Star Power slow duration was decreased to 2.5 seconds (from 3).}}\n*21/03/18:\n**{{Balance|Nerf|Shelly's main attack damage was decreased to 300 (from 320) per shell.}}\n**{{Balance|Neutral|Every Brawler's movement speed was increased by 70 points, increasing Shelly's movement speed to 720 (from 650).}} \n**{{Balance|Neutral|All Brawlers' projectile speeds are increased by 9%.}}\n*21/05/18:\n**{{Balance|Buff|Shelly's health was increased to 3600 (from 3200).}}\n*29/05/18:\n**{{Balance|Buff|Shelly's main attack range was increased to 7.33 tiles (from 6.67).}}\n*05/12/18:\n**{{Balance|Neutral|Shelly and and her Bandita Shelly skin were remodeled, and the Star Shelly skin was added.}}\n*12/12/18:\n**{{Balance|Neutral|Star Shelly became available to every user until 01/01/19.}}\n*15/04/19:\n**{{Balance|Buff|Shelly's main attack range was increased to 7.67 tiles (from 7.33).}}\n**{{Balance|Buff|Her main attack projectile speed was increased by 5%.}} \n*11/06/19:\n**{{Balance|Buff|Shelly's Shell Shock Star Power slow duration was increased to 3 seconds (from 2.5).}}\n*26/06/19:\n**{{Balance|Neutral|Shelly's Band-Aid Star Power was added.}}\n*29/08/19:\n**{{Balance|Nerf|Shelly's Band-Aid Star Power healing was decreased to 2000 (from reaching full health).}}\n*18/09/19:\n**{{Balance|Nerf|Shelly's Band-Aid Star Power healing was decreased to 1800 (from 2000).}}\n*23/10/19:\n**{{Balance|Neutral|Shelly's animations were reworked.}}\n*24/10/19:\n**{{Balance|Neutral|The Witch Shelly skin was added.
