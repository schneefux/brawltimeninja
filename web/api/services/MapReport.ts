The data source for this analysis is all Battles played by users of Brawl Time Ninja on Open Space in the mode Gem Grab.
For finding the best Brawler to play, you should consider the win rate and use rate.
Brawl Time Ninja calculates win rates like this: games won are divided by games played with this Brawler, with ties counting as 0.5 wins.
Brawlers with a high win rate are likely to be the best Brawlers because they win the most games.
However, Brawlers which are rarely used can have a high win rate because they are only played by experienced players.
This is why the use rate should be considered.
Brawl Time Ninja calculates the use rate as the fraction of players who chose this Brawler, weighted by how many Brawlers each player has unlocked.
A high win rate and a high use rate are the best indicators for a good Brawler, while a high win rate and a low use rate can indicate that a Brawler has high potential.
When choosing a Brawler, you should take your own play style and the Brawlers you are most comfortable with into account.`,

The data can be considered up to date when the last battle was collected less than 3 days ago. At the time of writing this analysis, the last battle was collected ${lastUpdate}.
The sample size should be large, which means there should be at least 50000 battles. This analysis is based on a sample of ${sampleSize} battles.
The margin of error for win rates is calculated from the sample size. It should be low, so that win rates have high accuracy. The margin of error is ${moe}, so win rates are calculated with ${moeRating} accuracy.

Brawl Time Ninja continuously collects data, you can use the dashboard to get the latest information or come back at a later date to read an updated analysis.

When choosing their Brawler and build, you should consider which Brawlers you are most likely to play with and against.
You can expect to meet many different Brawlers when the meta is diverse.
The Gini coefficient is a measure of diversity, calculated from the use rate. When it is 0, all Brawlers are used equally, when it is 1, only one Brawler is used.
For this data, the Gini coefficient is ${gini}, which is a ${giniRating} distribution of use rates.
Therefore, you can expect to ${giniRating == 'balanced' ? 'meet many different Brawlers' : 'meet some Brawlers more often than others'}.`
